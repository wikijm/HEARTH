Attackers could gain control over the system, leading to further exploitation and compromise of additional assets.\n- How does this hunt connect to known threat campaigns or protect critical assets?</br>This hunt is connected to known threat campaigns such as those conducted by APT41, APT41 (also known as Winnti Group), and other advanced threat actors. By detecting DLL sideloading attempts, organizations can protect critical assets like sensitive data, intellectual property, and critical infrastructure from being compromised.\n- Why would this hunt be valuable to the community?</br>This DLL sideloading technique is particularly valuable because it is often missed by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems. This is due to the fact that DLL sideloading can masquerade as legitimate application behavior, making it difficult for EDRs to differentiate between benign and malicious activity. Attackers exploit trusted binaries to load their malicious DLLs, effectively bypassing security controls.\nBy conducting hunts specifically targeting this behavior, we can identify and mitigate threats that would otherwise go undetected by traditional EDR solutions.
